CS 162 Projects Repository
=======================

Current repository contains my projects solutions of Berkley's "COMPUTER SCIENCE 162 — OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM PROGRAMMING" [course](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides/CS/162). Assigments: [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/sp22/)

# Projects Overview
Our projects in CS 162 will use [Pintos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos), an educational operating system. They’re designed to give you practical experience with the central ideas of operating systems in the context of developing a real, working kernel, without being excessively complex. The skeleton code for Pintos has several limitations in its file system, thread scheduler, and support for user programs. In the course of these projects, you will greatly improve Pintos in each of these areas.

# Course Overview
The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and operating systems concepts that appear in other advanced systems. Topics covered include operating systems, systems programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems, including multiple-program systems (processes, interprocess communication, synchronization), memory allocation (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions, security and privacy.
